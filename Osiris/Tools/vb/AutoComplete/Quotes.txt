The art of war is of vital importance to the state.  It is a matter of life and death, a road either to safety or ruin.  Hence under no circumstances can it be neglected.
Let your plans be dark and impenetrable as nigh, and when you move, fall like a thunderbolt.
There are roads that must not be followed, towns that must not be beseiged.
To begin by bluster, but afterward to take fright at the enemy's numbers, shows a supreme lack of intelligence.
Rapidity is the essence of war.  Take advantage of the enemy's unreadiness, make your way by unexpected routes, and attack unguarded spots.
